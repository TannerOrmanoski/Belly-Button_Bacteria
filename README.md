# Belly-Button_Bacteria

## Purpose 

The purpose of this project was to create an interactive dashboard, that is connected to a dataset. The dataset revolves around a study, in which 
multiple participants had their belly buttons swabbed for bacteria and the bacteria strains recorded. With this dashboard, the participants can select
their id number, and review information about the bacteria found in their navels. This information is portrayed through three visualizations: a bar chart, 
a gauge chart, and a bubble chart.
